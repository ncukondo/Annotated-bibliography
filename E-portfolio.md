# E-portfolio

## Why E-portfolio

## Data flow in E-portfolio

E-portfolio is expected to have 

1. the ability to collect feedback and learning results
2. integrate data from multiple platforms
3. visualize the integrated data to help the stakeholder get the holistic view from the integrated data

Van Der Vleuten et al., 2015 PMID:25410481

## Burden

- Filling out e-portfolio is a burden

## Student model

- Probabilistic representation of a learner’s state and educational context
- a statistical model
  - translates the existing E-portfolio performance scores into the progress state of the learner

### Types of student model

- Overlay model
  - proper subset of the knowledge of the entire domain
- Differential model
  - the domain knowledge is decomposed into necessary and unnecessary (or optional)
- Perturbation model
  - student ’s knowledge is dichotomized into“correct” and “incorrect”.
- Constraint-based model
  - s the domain knowledge is represented by a set of constraints over the problem state
