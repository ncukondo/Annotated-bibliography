# Interpretation of narrative feedback

## Why interpret narrative feedback automatically?

- interpretation of aggregated, longitudinal narrative feedback
  - proven to be very challenging
  - cognitively demanding
  - time consuming

- assessment practices witnessed a change
  - from an almost exclusive focus on quantitative assessment data
    - like grades or scores
  - towards provision of rich, narrative and personalized feedback
