# Transformative Learning Theory

assists learners  to make sense of new learning [@Ryan2022-ma]

## 10 steps of transformative learning

- Phase 1. A disorienting dilemma
  - Encountering a homeless person in the street and hearing their story
- Phase 2. Self-examination with feelings of guilt or shame
  - Feeling guilty that one had not considered the difficulties facing homeless people
- Phase 3. A critical assessment of assumptions
  - Realising that one had previously judged homeless people without considering individual reasons or hardships faced
- Phase 4. Recognition that one’s discontent and process of transformation are shared and that others have negotiated a similar change
  - Discussion with peers around the subject and how best to help those in need
- Phase 5. Exploration of options for new roles, relationships, and actions
  - Considering new ways of interacting with homeless people
- Phase 6. Planning of a course of action
  - Donating to a charity to help homeless or displaced people, or volunteering to help at a homeless shelter
- Phase 7. Acquisition of knowledge and skills for implementing one’s plans
- Phase 8. Provisionally trying out new roles
- Phase 9. Building of competence and self-confidence in new roles and relationships
- Phase 10. A reintegration into one’s life on the basis of conditions dictated by one’s new perspective
