# Problem-gap-hook heuristic

@Lingard2015-on proposed a heuristic to identify the problem gap in the literature. The heuristic is called problem-gap-hook heuristic. The heuristic is a three-step process:

1. Identify the problem
2. Establish a gap
3. Articulate a hook

Ideally, these three elements appear in the first paragraph or two.

## Example

- Problem
  - Conflicting Evidence in Duty Hours Reform
  - > Duty hours reform is predicated on the assumption that working fewer consecutive hours will result in more and better-quality sleep hours, which will yield residents who will provide safer patient care. Existing research is focused primarily on interventions and outcomes related to residents’ on-duty experiences; results of these studies are conflicting and have been used variably to justify or criticize duty hours reform.
- Gap
  - A lack of information about what residents do with their postcall time
  - > With very little research into what residents actually do postcall and how they decide what to do, we do not know what influences residents’ decisions about their postcall time.
- Hook
  - this information is necessary to ensure the effectiveness of initiatives designed to improve the situation
  - > Consequently, it is unclear whether postcall behaviours are particularly entrenched, or what educational or organizational strategies might be implemented to influence them. The lack of such insight is a critical gap in the literature, as researchers have recently found that residents were unlikely to change or improve their sleep habits based solely on an educational intervention to improve their knowledge of sleep physiology principles.

## Points

- Problem is not the same as the topic
  - Topic: `Team communication plays an important role in patient safety.`
  - Problem: `Adverse events resulting from error happen at unacceptably high rates in hospital, and ineffective communication among team members is often a contributing factor.`
  - Problem has greater sense of urgency
- problem/gap/hook is not the same as your research question and purpose statement
  - purpose statement and research question
    - > Leadership is increasingly recognized as an important competency for physicians. At the same time, collaboration is growing as a value and expectation of health care delivery. What has not been explored is the relationship between leadership and collaboration in physicians’ practice. The purpose of this study was to explore this relationship by asking ‘How do physicians experience leadership and collaboration during their daily team interactions?’
  - problem/gap/hook
    - > Leadership and collaboration are highly valued and potentially conflicting competencies in medical practice. While there has been attention to leadership and to collaboration individually, little attention has been paid to how they interact. With physicians experiencing increasingly formal expectations that they will lead and collaborate effectively, (e.g., CanMEDS 2015), we require systematic knowledge about how these competencies play out in clinical teams.
