# Feedback by AI

## Pre-LLMs era

### Review about Automatic feedback in online learning

1. 65.07% of the studies  demonstrate  that automatic feedback increases  student performance  in activities
2. 46.03% of the studies demonstrated that there is no evidence that automatic feedback eases instructors’ workload
3. 82.53%  of the studies showed that there is no evidence that manual feedback is more efficient than  automatic feedback
4. the main  method used for automatic feedback provision is the comparison with a  desired answer in some subject

#### Methods used for automatic feedback provision

### workplace-based assessment in professional education

- professional education
  - medical education
  - veterinary education
  - teacher education
- student models developed by AI
  - source data
    - progress in e-portfolios
    - assessment from evaluators(Mini-CEX, DOPS, etc.)
- type of feedback
  - narrative
  - numeric
  - visual

### teacher to other teacher feedback vs automated feedback

- e-portfolio in in-service teacher professional development course “Lesson observation and analysis”
- automated feedback
  - based on
    - performance scores in the e-portfolio
- human feedback
  - by feedback providers(other teachers)
- conclusion
  - Automated feedback is effective
  - but feedback based on human communication and trust is still necessary

## Post-LLMs era

### Feedback on students’ proposal reports on data science course

1. ChatGPT  is  capable  of generating  more  detailed  feedback  that  fluently  and  coherently summarizes  students’  performance  than  human  instructors
2. ChatGPT  achieved  high  agreement  with  the  instructor  when assessing  the  topic  of  students’  assignments
3. ChatGPT could provide feedback on the process of students completing the task,  which  benefits  students  developing  learning  skills.

### Empathetic ChatBot vs teacher's feedback

- Context
  - Data Science Lab (DSLab) course
    - Computer Science Engineering and Telecommunication Engineering programs of an online higher education institution
- Design
  - quasi-experimental study
- participants
  - students
  - N=196
- Empathetic ChatBot (DSLab-Bot)
- Groups
  - control group: teacher's feedback
  - experimental group: DSLab-Bot's feedback
- Data
  - quantitative data
    - students’ learning performance in each one of the Practical Assignment phases
    - questionnaire
  - the student processing of feedback and student perceptions
    - a five-point  Likert-type scale
    - cognitive feedback, affective feedback, Motivation, Self-regulation, and metacognitive reasoning

### Feedback on writing

- Study1
  - 48 university English as a new  language (ENL) learner
  - a six-week long repeated measures
  - quasi-experimental study
    - experimental group: ChatGPT(GP-4) feedback
    - control group: human teacher feedback
  - Result
    - no difference in learning outcomes
- Study 2
  - participants
    - 43 ENLs
    - received both ChatGPT and human tutor university ENL learners
  - analysis
    - a questionnaire analyzing perceptions
      - eight five-point likert scale item
        - satisfaction, comprehensibility and clarity, helpfulness, and overall preference
      - A follow-up open-ended question
  - Result
    - a near even split in preference for AI-generated or human-generated feedback
    - human tutor
      - personal interaction to be “more engaging” and “a  fun  way  to  learn”  when  compared  to  just  reading  through  AI-generated  feedback
      - ability  to  ask  follow-up  questions  and  get  immediate  feedback  as  being   instrumental.
      - reliance  on  AI  might  unintentionally  result  in  the  erasure  of  the   personal voice of the writer
    - AI-generated feedback
      - clarity,  understandability,  consistency,  and  specificity  of  feedback
        - especially  in  regards  to  academic   writing style and vocabulary
      - tutors have limited time and can only get  limited feedback

### automated, personalized feedback on each instructor’s uptake of student

- Code in Place
  - a 5-week, free online computer science  course  organized  by  Stanford  University
- Instructor’s uptake of student feedback
  - namely,    instances    when    a    teacher    
acknowledges, revoices, and uses students’ ideas  as  resources  in  their  instruction
- automated,  personalized feedback
  - a 4-step process
    1. Recording
    2. Transcription  and  Anonymization
    3. Transcript Analysis
    4. Generating  the  Feedback.

## Issue with AI feedback

- AI enable customized  learning and offer personalized  learning

- limited scientific evidence
  - on the impact of AI on the learning  of the  students and faculty
- more personalization requires more computer power
  - more  personalization and continuous  and real-time  feedback  require  greater  computational  power  and  thus  make  AI’s    feedback process  multistep and more complicated
- lack of trust  in the systems, and recognition of  existing classroom  norms  and ethics
- they may largely remain biased
  - because they do not address and do not aim to normalize the subjective  nature of data
