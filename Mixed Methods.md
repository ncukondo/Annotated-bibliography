# Mixed methods approach

## What?

- is not just a matter of using different methods together
- might mix
  - measure  concepts  in  different  ways
  - measure different constructs
  - use multiple data collection methods
  - use multiple interconnected  studies
  - synthesize  multiple  studies
  - construct  multivariate  causal  models
  - competitively test rival models and hypotheses
  - engage multiple stakeholders
  - employ multiple theoretical  and  value  frameworks
  - use  multiple  analytical  techniques  and  analysts
  - pursue multiple different questions and issues

### Designs and frameworks

- Three basic designs
  - Convergent
    - concurrent
  - Explanatory sequential
    - quant -> qual
  - Exploratory sequential
    - qual -> quant
- Four advanced frameworks
  - multistage
  - intervention
  - case study
  - participatory

### Mixed Methods Research Designs

#### Convergent Design (One-Phase Design)

```mermaid
graph LR
    A1[Quantitative Data Collection and Analysis] --> B{Merge Results}
    A2[Qualitative Data Collection and Analysis] --> B
    B --> C[Interpret Results to Compare]
```

[@Creswell2022-qa]

#### Explanatory Sequential Design (Two-Phase Design)

```mermaid
graph LR
    D1[Quantitative Data Collection and Analysis] --> E{Identify Results for Follow-Up}
    E --> F[Qualitative Data Collection and Analysis]
    F --> G[Interpret Results—How Qualitative Explains Quantitative]
```
[@Creswell2022-qa]

#### Exploratory Sequential Design (Three-Phase Design)

```mermaid
graph LR
    H1[Qualitative Data Collection and Analysis] --> I[Identify Feature for Testing]
    I --> J[Quantitatively Test the Feature Designed]
    J --> K[Interpret Results—How Test Improves the Results]
```

### Stance

- a  purist  stance
  - methods  must  share  a  common  mental model to be combinable
- a-paradigmatic stance
  - practical needs are more important  than philosophical inconsistencies
- a substantive theory stance
  - theory is more important  than method
- a complementary strengths stance
  - different paradigms yield important different  perspectives
- a  dialectical  stance
  - juxtapositions  of  methods  afford  new  insights
- an  alternative  paradigms  stance
  - pragmatic,  realist,  and  emancipatory  approaches  to   inquiry

### How to mix?

- triangulation
  - results from one method confirm those from another
- complementarity
  - results from  different  methods  add  breadth  and  depth
- development
  - results  from  method  inform  the   use of others
- initiation
  - different methods offer usefully conflicting views
- expansion
  - different methods are used for exploring different constructs or phenomena
