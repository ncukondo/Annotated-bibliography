#### Various Definitions from a Review

- Digital Transformation in Higher Education Institutions: A Systematic Literature Review [@Benavides2020-my]

Paper | Digital Transformation
-- | --
[10] | DT is fundamentally about change and it involves people, processes, strategies, structures, and competitive dynamics [11].
[12] | Digital disruption is defined as the changes facilitated by digital technologies that occur at a pace and magnitude that disrupt established ways of value creation, social interactions, doing business and more generally our thinking [13].
[14] | The realignment of, or new investment in, technology and business models to more effectively engage digital customers at every touch point in the customer experience lifecycle. Companies needed to think of DT as a “formal effort to renovate business vision, models, and investments for a new digital economy [15].”
[16] | DT goes well beyond de-materialization of processes, encompassing an innovative use of new technologies (cloud, social, mobile, and analytics) to promote new services, re-define business models, and innovative interactions with its users.
[17] | DT of the university education system should have a broader focus and must include the modernization of corporate IT architecture management, which could provide an important contribution to structuring the efforts of innovation in education.
[18] | The modern developments in the area of modernizing educational system with the aid of ITC technology and applied process thinking principles in the attempt to capture and model interrelated activities required to integrate digital technologies in teaching, learning, and organizational practices.
[19] | DT is an accelerated evolution. It is also revolution because of its radical and structural implications for people as for infrastructure that also requires new educational and business models.
[20] | Digital business transformation can be defined as the modification of business processes, procedures, capabilities and policies to take advantage of the changes and opportunities presented by new digital technologies, as well as the impact they have on society, while always thinking about current and future trends.

1. Digitization
   - convert analog information to digital form
   - a digital representation of a physical object, data, documents, photographic materials, etc.
2. Digitalization
    - convert current process to use digital technology
    - actual use of digitization in practice
3. Digital transformation
    - adapting digital technology to core operation and business model
    - the process of using digital technologies to create new — or modify existing — business processes, culture, and customer experiences to meet changing business and market requirements
