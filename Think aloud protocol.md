# Think aloud protocol

## What?

- The combination of the think aloud interview and protocol analysis
- Two components
  - think aloud interview
    - a technique for verbal data collection
  - protocol analysis
    - a technique for predicting and analyzing verbal data
- Useful method for understanding the individual thought process

## How?

### Think aloud interview

#### Four steps

1. Task selection
   - should allow participants to vocalize at least every 5-15s
   - more frequent vocalization is better
   - ideally be cognitive tasks
   - should not result in high cognitive load
     - difficult to simultaneously vocalize
2. Verbal timing selection
   - Verbalization can be concurrent or retrospective
   - recall required for retrospective
think aloud interview is typically unreliable
3. Participant preparation
    - clear instructions and an opportunity to practice
    - participants should practice verbalizations during a familiar task
4. Verbal data collection
    - during the task, the interviewer should minimize interruptions

### Protocol analysis

1. Task analysis
2. Anticipated coding scheme
3. Vocalization independence or segmenting
   - do not include interviewer or environmental cues
4. Vocalization type
   - inner speech
   - referent
   - thought description
5. Vocalization ordering
   - Protocol analysis purists favor randomly ordering the verbal segments
   - adding a timestamp for each segment is to allow for ran- dom ordered coding and then repeat coding in chronological order
6. Vocalization coding
7. Revisit task analysis
