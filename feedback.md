# Feedback

## What?

> Information provided by an agent (e.g., teacher, peer, book, parent, self, experience) regarding aspects of one's performance or understanding

[@Hattie2007-kx]

## Purpose

- To reduce discrepancies between current understandings and performance and a goal

[@Hattie2007-kx]

## Three questions

- Where am I going?
  - What are the goals?
- How am I going?
  - What progress is being made toward the goal?
- Where to next?
  - What activities need to be undertaken to make better progress?

[@Hattie2007-kx]

## Focus of feedback

- Task
  - Feedback about the task itself
- Process
  - Feedback about the processes used to complete the task
- Self-regulation
  - Feedback about the self as a learner
- Self
  - Feedback about the self as a person

## Models

### Focusing on the way of giving feedback

#### Five step microskills model

1. get a commitment
2. probe for supporting evidence
3. teach general rules
4. reinforce what was done right
5. correct mistakes

[@Neher1992-qr]

### Focusing on the feedback receiver

#### Feedback Literacy

see [Feedback Literacy](Feedback%20Literacy.md)

[@Carless2018-ul]

### Focusing on the process of feedback

#### Three conditions for feedback loop

1 student knowledge of the standards that needs to be applied
2. having to compare those standards to the students’ own work
3. the student taking action to close the gap between the two

[@Boud2012-gs]

#### Feedback Loop

- traditional view of feedback from engineering
  - a process in which information about the past or the present influences the same phenomenon in the present or future
  - a feedback loop is a system structure that causes output from one node to eventually influence input to that same node
- In feedback loops
  - Feedback is information about the gap between the actual level and the reference level of a system parameter which is used to alter the gap in some way  - needs monitoring students’ work to determine if the information provided to them had an effect on what they did
- completion of a feedback  loop is needed to adjust the actions of teachers to ensure an impact on student learning
- Without this information, teachers are blind to the consequences of their actions and cannot therefore act effectively to improve the quality of learning

[@Boud2012-gs]

##### Criticism of feedback loop

- not sustainable
  - too much work for teachers (it is difficult to monitor all students’ work)
  - In the long term, studentswill graduate and the infrastructure of support for learning that this model assumes has to fade and disappear

[@Boud2012-gs]

### Feedback Culture and Growing mindset

[@Ramani2019-ap]

#### Twelve tips for giving feedback effectively in the clinical environment

1. Establish a positive learning climate and be a professional role-model
2. Use direct observation of performance to generate feedback data
3. Facilitate reflection and informed self-assessment
4. Foster a growth mind-set among learners
5. Encourage feedback seeking behavior
6. Promote learner initiated action plans for behavior change
7. Establish an educational alliance
8. Encourage teachers and learners co-create learning opportunities for behavior change
9. Ensure appropriate attention to learner self-efficacy
10. Promote optimal balance of supervision and autonomy
11. Establish a continuous practice improvement environment
12. Emphasize a feedback culture that enhances professional growth

## Role of technology-enhanced approaches

- Facilitating timely and convenient sharing of comments
- Students generally value
  - personalised and engaging nature of audio feedback
- Recent developments in learning analytics enable
  - information based on learning logs
  - digital traces to provide timely personalised feedback at scale

### Risks related to technology-enhanced approarches

- the process may still be dominated by feedback as telling
  - may inhibit students responsibility
- not ensue unless there are designs for student uptake
  - learner agency may be lacking
