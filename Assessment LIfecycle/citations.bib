  abstract = "Provision of feedback forms an integral part of the learning
              process. Receipt of feedback enriches the learning experience,
              and helps to narrow the gap between actual and desired
              performance. Effective feedback helps to reinforce good practice,
              motivating the learner towards the desired outcome. However, a
              common complaint from learners is that the receipt of feedback is
              infrequent and inadequate. This paper briefly explores the role
              of feedback within the learning process, the barriers to the
              feedback process, and practical guidelines for facilitating
              feedback.",

  abstract  = "Purpose Because of the increasingly higher expectations of
               accrediting organizations, calls for greater accountability from
               state governments, and students' demand for an education that
               prepares them for a career, most hospitality programs are now
               required to have an effective assessment of learning outcomes
               process. The increasing popularity of the assessment of learning
               outcomes process is viewed as highly positive because it can be
               considered as best practices in higher education. The paper aims
               to discuss this issue.Design/methodology/approach This is Part 1
               of a two-part article that provides an overview of the
               justifications for implementing an assessment of learning
               outcomes process, the steps that were developed by two
               hospitality programs and the experiences of the two programs
               during implementation of the seven steps. Part 1 includes
               foundational principles of the process and the first three of
               the seven steps.Findings The steps in a closed-loop assessment
               of learning outcomes process are relatively detailed; however,
               because of changes in expectations of stakeholders and the
               requirements of accreditors, they are now mandatory for most
               hospitality programs. Therefore, the choice is not whether to
               implement them, but when to implement them. From a competitive
               standpoint, it is to the program's advantage to begin as soon as
               possible. Another factor to consider is that the implementation
               of an effective closed-loop assessment of learning outcomes
               process will take several years to complete.Originality/value
               This paper is presenting a critical view of one of, if not the
               most important concepts in higher education, the closed-loop
               assessment of learning outcomes process. Hopefully, the
               information on the process that is provided and the experiences
               of the two programs can shorten the learning curve for other
               hospitality programs.",
