# Participatory Design

## What

- a valuable approach for instructional design
  - Teachers, educational designers and students bring together their exper- tise and experiences to jointly design instruction [@Konings2017-mg]

## Why

### In technology

- To designing human-centered technology[@Van_Leeuwen2023-do]
  - tailor the technological solution[@Van_Leeuwen2023-do]
  - identify the stakeholders’ needs [@Van_Leeuwen2023-do]
- a more human, creative, and effective relationship betvween those involved in technology’s design  and  its  use[@Cober2015-le]

#### In learning analytics(LA)

- Alleviate the mismatch between the design of learning analytics(LA) platforms and the capacity and interests of educators and students[@Dollinger2018-fm]

Current LA Issues | Potential of Co-Creation within LA
--|--
Mismatch between design and capacity | Increased flexibility and ‘fit for purpose’"
Invalid Inferences | Sensemaking
Reconceptualization from product to service | Change in process, long term adoption

[@Dollinger2018-fm]

## Process

### For human-centered technology

1. Agentic positioning of central stakeholders
2. using a structured approach for the design phase
3. using educational theories to guide the whole process

[@Van_Leeuwen2023-do]

## Examples

### AI education and Participatory Design

- designing AI system, teacher dashboards
- tension between...
  - involving stakeholder
  - use of educational theory
- Teacher dashboards
  - AI system
  - visual displays of capture and visualization of students's activities
- Structure
  1. description of participatory design of teacher dashboards
  2. implications of connecting insights from the field of teacher professional vision to participatory design practices

[@Van_Leeuwen2023-do]

### Developing dashboard

In the competency-based residency training program for emergency medicine at the University of Saskatchewan, participatory development was employed in the research for the development of a dashboard to support learning [@Yilmaz2021-mq; @Yilmaz2022-vf; @Carey2020-ls].

#### To meet the needs of residents

- four resident focus group
  - Grounded theory
- Result
  1. Provide guidance through the assessment program
  2. Present  workplace-based  assessment  data
  3. Present  other  assessment  data

[@Carey2020-ls]

#### For faculty development

- Phases
  - Phase 1. Analysis and exploration
  - Phase 2. Design and construction
  - Phase 3. Evaluation and reflection
  - Phase 4. Implementation and spread
- Study
  - Qual
    - thematically  analyzed
    - constant comparative method

[@Yilmaz2021-mq]

#### For Program evaluation

- Research Question
  - Identify  program evaluation  needs  for  the  analysis  and  presentation  of  competency-based  assessments  while  developing  a  dashboard  to  meet  them
- Design
- Study
  - Qual
    - 16 interviews with six participants
      - two EM residency program leaders
      - four institutional leaders
    - constant comparative  method
- Phases
  - Phase 1. Analysis and exploration
  - Phase 2. Design and construction
  - Phase 3. Evaluation and reflection
  - Phase 4. Implementation and spread
- Result
  - Four main themes
    - tracking changes in overall assessment metrics
    - comparing metrics to the assessment plan
    - tracking changes in overall assessment metrics
    - engagement with the assessment metrics
