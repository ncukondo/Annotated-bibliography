## Comparison between reviews

|  | Narrative reviews  | Systematic reviews  |
|--|--|--|
| Main Features  | Describe and appraise published articles but the methods used to select the articles may not be described.  | The query is well defined [review question, secondary question(s) and/or subgroup analyses]. Clearly defined criteria for the selection of articles from the literature. Explicit methods of extraction and synthesis of the data. Comprehensive research to find all the relevant studies. Application of standards for the critical appraisal of the studies quality. |
| Uses/applications  | General debates, appraisal of previous studies and the current lack of knowledge. Rationales for future research. Speculate on new types of interventions available.  | Identify, assess and synthesize the literature gathered in response to a specific query. Collect what is known about a topic and identify the basis of that knowledge. Comprehensive report with explicit processes so that rational, assumptions and methods are open to examination by external organizations.  |
| Limitations  | The assumptions and the planning are not often known. Selection and evaluation biases not known. Not reproducible.  | The scope is limited by the defined query, search terms, and the selection criteria. Usually reader needs to reformulate the alternative questions that have not been answered by the main query.  |
