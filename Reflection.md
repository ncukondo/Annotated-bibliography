### A pragmatic approach to categorizing reflective material

| Grade | Description |
| --- | --- |
| A | Experiencing an event(s) has changed, or confirmed, how you experience an event (s). You may wish to change how you respond to similar event(s in the future. You provide an explanation, including references to other literature, eg articles or books. |
| B | Involves judgement – what went well, or less well and why.  |
| C | Describing an event – recognising how it affects your feelings, attitudes and  beliefs and/or questioning what has been learnt and comparing it to previous experience. |
| D | Describing an event – recognising that something is important but not explaining  why. |
| E | Describing an event – repeating the details of an event without offering any  interpretation. |
| F | Describing an event – poor description of an event.  |

### Based on stages in professional development

| Grade | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Committed reflection | There is a discussion of what has been learned, how it has affected the individual and how they feel that they have changed. Some presentation of evidence to back this up should be provided. |
| Emotional exploration | There is evidence of the emotional impact of an experience and this includes insights and discussion about their own beliefs and values, including how these have been challenged. |
| Objective reporting | There is only a descriptive account of what happened during the experience with no evidence of reflection, or how the experience has affected them. |
| Diffuse reporting | The description is unfocused or disorganized and contains only a description of the experience. |
