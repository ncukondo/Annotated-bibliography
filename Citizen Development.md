# Citizen Development

## What is Citizen Development?

- Strives to empower non-IT employees
  - to design, build,and deploy their own software applications
  - to an increased workflow automation
  - [@Binzer2022-bg]
- A novel software engineering paradigm
  - enables and supports the development of software by non-IT professionals [@Binzer2022-bg]
- Growing movement which describes a new trend across businesses
  - to empower traditionally non-IT employees to collaborate with IT professionals to build effective and innovative applications [@McHugh2023-qe]
- A new method of delivering low-code/no-code (LC/NC) development
  - as part of their digital transformation toolkit [@Carroll2023-jx]
  - IT support and training provided for business users and management’s awareness of the range of tool [@Carroll2023-jx]

## Why?

- Rising demands for digital solutions in the context of digital transformation [@Binzer2022-bg]
- the increased need for faster adaptations to a fast-changing business environment [@Binzer2022-bg]
- the shortage of skilled IT resources [@Binzer2022-bg]
- To meet growing business demands for digital solutions without overwhelming or expanding the IT department [@Carroll2023-jx]
- the importance of collectivity as
citizen development significantly broadens the number of people who can assist with their creativity and competence in an organization’s digital transformation [@Binzer2022-bg]
- Rapid design, development and deployment of applications in a hyperagile manner is the organizational equivalent of project management agility [@Carroll2023-jx]
- To enhance productivity and foster innovation, support through programming is essential [@Carroll2023-jx]

## Who is Citizen Developer?

- Empowered problem solvers who rapidly develop applications using innovative and intuitive software to create applications that are accessible through LC/NC platforms [@Carroll2023-jx]
- non-IT employees who have no formal IT education, but possess great business expertise and in-depth knowledge of business processes [@Binzer2022-bg]

## Benefits

- Empowers subject matter experts—allowing us to view digital solutions as building blocks rather than a complex process [@McHugh2023-qe]
- cut down routine work and tackle frequent pain points of daily work [@Binzer2022-bg]
- do not need to be fully aligned and translated between business and IT [@Binzer2022-bg]
- organizations can increase their overall capacity to develop digital solutions [@Binzer2022-bg]
- unlock a new source of intrapreneurial business innovation [@Binzer2022-bg]

## Challenges

- limitations of contemporary LCDPs [@Binzer2022-bg]
- question the abilities of citizen developers [@Binzer2022-bg]
  - firms perceive application development on [@Binzer2022-bg]
LCDPs still as complex task that requires specialized skills
- integration limitations
- quality concerns
- security concerns
  - Shadow IT
    - the use and management of any IT technologies, solutions, services and infrastructure without formal approval and support of the internal IT department [@Carroll2023-jx]
- Development with Low/No-Code is challenging for an experienced software developer [@Hallberg2021-hy]

## Enablers

- Technologies
  - modern LCDPs with their easy-to-use graphical interface capabilities [@Binzer2022-bg]
  - Growing investments in LC/NC platforms by both established and startup suppliers [@Carroll2023-jx]
  - pre-built components [@Binzer2022-bg]

## Strategy for Implementation

- DIY coaching [@Carroll2023-jx]
- Active top management support
  - proactively drive change management
- Centralized IT governance
- External partner involvement
- Encouraged to recognize and realize that digital innovation could happen on all levels of an organization
- Necessary tools and equip their citizen developers with the required skills and mindset
- Different implementation strategies arise from an organization’s individual context

[@Binzer2022-bg]

## Governance

- a new way of collaboration between business and IT units
- citizen development programs under centralized IT governance structures in order to ensure security, compliance, data integrity, and efficiency
- IT department should seek to closely collaborate, support, and partner with citizen developers, instead of acting as a gatekeeper
- Collaboration efforts can thereby be achieved through interaction and
knowledge exchange in established communities or the setup of cross-functional teams

[@Binzer2022-bg]

## Research Agenda

- Individual
  - Which types of citizen developers exist, and how can they be classified?
  - How do citizen developers perceive and feel about their role?
  - What motivates citizen developers, and how do they approach tasks?
- Team
  - How do citizen developers integrate themselves into cross-functional teams?
  - How do citizen development practices diffuse within and across teams?
  - How can teams and team performance benefit from citizen developers?
- Organizational
  - How do firms implement citizen development strategies?
  - How can citizen development training and up skilling be organized?
  - How should the ownership of support and maintenance for citizen-developed digital solutions be managed?
  - How can firms measure organization-wide citizen development success?
- Ecosystem
  - How do citizen development strategies differ across ecosystems?
  - What are market opportunities for third-party providers?
  - How does citizen development differ between private and public firms?

## In medical education and healthcare

- A review in website [@Eddy2021-pb]
- A review about laws related to collecting research data throuth low code tools [@Totterdale2018-sn]

### Examples

#### Mobile health research

- Tool
  - Pathverse(no code)
- Frameworks
  - a  participatory framework
  - Agile and hybrid-agile software development process

[@Liu2022-xn]
  
#### Collect patient-generated health data and send to EHR 

- Tool
  - Mendix and Better EHR Studio(low code)
- Framework
  - prototype development
- Challenges
  - also challenging  for  an experienced  software developer

[@Hallberg2021-hy]

#### Developing mobile health apps for hypertension prevention

- Tool
  - Pathverse(no code)
- Frameworks
  - prototype development
  - iterative development

[@Willms2023-db]

## Other Examples

### Training of secondary school teachers of Citizen Developers

- Research Question
  1. What are teachers’ attitudes toward Citizen Development?
  2. What are the challenges toward the integration of Citizen Development into their own teaching practices?
  3. What are teachers’ perceptions of a LCNC training program and its applicability to a school environment?
- 18 secondary school teachers
- Mixed Methods
  - quantitative pre- and post- training surveys
  - qualitatively coded teacher interviews
- Results:
  - it is timely to leverage the increased use of technologies in the classroom before teaching reverts to pre-pandemic norms of “face-to- face.”
  - CD provides an excellent opportunity to introduce teach- ers and students to aspects of computer science without placing demands on them to develop technical skills.

### Layered team approach in Collaborative robot - Participatory Programming

Programming Layer | Task | Roles and Expertise | Required Training | Supporting techniques
-- | -- | -- | -- | --
Layer 1 | Basic assembly workflows (robot movements and tool actuation) | Assembly workers and laypersons with some assembly experience |  | Some technical training  (e.g. professional  school)
Layer 2 | Blockbased programs (task blocks, variables, and control structures) | Industrial engineers with computational thinking abilities and technical intuition  | Formal technical training and a programming course  | CAD-modelling, 3Dprinting, laser cutting
Layer 3 | Advanced functionality (databases, connectivity, etc.)  | Software engineers with  advanced programming skills  | Formal software engineering training  | Internet / intranet, databases, cloud, MES
