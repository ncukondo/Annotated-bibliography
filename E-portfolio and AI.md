# E-portfolio and AI

## Examples of usage of AI in e-portfolio

### An e-portfolio that combines a student model, feedback generation, and a visualization module

1. Design competencies and EPAs
2. Develop a student model
   - Using multi-entity Bayesian networks
   - Sources:
     - pedagogical knowledge
     - written  or  electronic  tests
     - CbD
     - Mini-CEX
     - DOPS
     - Multi-Source Feedback (MSF)
3. Develop personalized feedback and visualization
   - Using a rule-based system
   - informs comparison of the studentâ€™s performance with the expected performance
   - and provides suggestions for improvement
4. Implement the e-portfolio
   - 4 steps to implement from mock up to the final version
   - The system is tested with 202 students and 141 faculty members
