# Design based research

## Characteristics

1. Focus on complex problems in real learning context
2. Continuous cycles of
   - Design
   - Evaluation
   - Redesign
3. Based on theoretical principles
4. Mixed-methods studies
5. designers, researchers, and practitioners work together

[@Dolmans2012-lq]

### Compare to action research

- Same
  - Iterative process
  - Cyclic process
    - Design
    - Evaluation
    - Redesign
  - Evaluating....
    - particular intervention meets certain basic standards
    - aspects of the intervention need improvement
- Difference
  - DBR require connection with theories
  - DBR testing or refining  theories

[@Dolmans2012-lq]

### Pitfalls

- Only of practical relevance for local situation
  - To avoid
    - grounding the design on theories and using theories to explain the findings.
    - detailed description of the context
    - generating design principles
- Does not advance theories
- The involvement of the researcher bias findings
  - To avoid
    - Triangulation of data sources and data methods
    - reflexivity
- DBR is risky, complicated, and time-consuming
  - teachers or learners may withdraw
  - circumstances may change

[@Dolmans2012-lq]

### Research Questions

- How does it work?
- Why does it work?

[@Dolmans2012-lq]

### Application

- Work-based learning
- Assessment

[@Dolmans2012-lq]

#### Example in AMEE No.60

### Design and evaluation of a clinical competency committee

- Research questions
  - how CCCs actually function in practice
  - how their performance should be evaluated
    - to see effect of an intervention in a real-life setting
- Design principles
  1. data from multiple assessment tools and multiple perspectives
  2. a shared mental model
  3. structured discussion to reach consensus
- Evaluation methods
  - Observation of the meeting using a semi-structured observation guide
  - Individual, semi-structured interviews with all members of the committee
  - Questionnaire with open-ended questions to be completed by all residents

## Medical curricula on the four dimensions of care

![](Design%20based%20research/2022-12-29-10-51-02.png)

- Four Dimensions of care
  - physical
  - psychological
  - social
  - spiritual
- Research Question
  - How do students and teachers evaluate an assignment in which students communicate with a chronically ill patient about the four dimensions of care, provide each other with peer feedback and reflect?
- Theoretical principle
  - authentic task
  - peer feedback and reflection
- Studies
  - QUAL
    - Thematic analysis
    - focus groups with students
    - interviews with teachers
    - an analysis of reflection reports
  - QUAN
    - SPSS
    - Student evaluation form
- Cycle
  - we evaluate the intervention to redesign it
  - no redesign was described
  - just one cycle?

## Designing internet-enabled patient education for self-management of T2D diabetes

- Studies
  - QUAL(only qualitative)
    - interview with patients and care-givers
    - observations of participant using the prototype
- Theoretical principle
  - self-management?
  - culture specific care?
  - user-driven model
  - self-care model
- Two care models
  - User-driven model
  - Self-care model
- Research Questions
  - how to design a portal prototype to support the self-management of diabetes patients in a specific cultural context in Iran
- Result
  - Phase
    1. Mock-ups
    2. self-care improvement
    3. educational usefulness
  - Phase 2. Portal prototype
    - user experience
    - functionality
    - interactivity

### Developing dashboard

In the competency-based residency training program for emergency medicine at the University of Saskatchewan, participatory development was employed in the research for the development of a dashboard to support learning [@Yilmaz2021-mq; @Yilmaz2022-vf; @Carey2020-ls].

#### to meet the needs of residents

- four resident focus group
  - Grounded theory
- Result
  1. Provide guidance through the assessment program
  2. Present  workplace-based  assessment  data
  3. Present  other  assessment  data

[@Carey2020-ls]

#### for faculty development

- Phases
  - Phase 1. Analysis and exploration
  - Phase 2. Design and construction
  - Phase 3. Evaluation and reflection
  - Phase 4. Implementation and spread
- Study
  - Qual
    - thematically  analyzed
    - constant comparative method

[@Yilmaz2021-mq]

#### for Program evaluation

- Research Question
  - Identify  program evaluation  needs  for  the  analysis  and  presentation  of  competency-based  assessments  while  developing  a  dashboard  to  meet  them
- Design
- Study
  - Qual
    - 16 interviews with six participants
      - two EM residency program leaders
      - four institutional leaders
    - constant comparative  method
- Phases
  - Phase 1. Analysis and exploration
  - Phase 2. Design and construction
  - Phase 3. Evaluation and reflection
  - Phase 4. Implementation and spread
- Result
  - Four main themes
    - tracking changes in overall assessment metrics
    - comparing metrics to the assessment plan
    - tracking changes in overall assessment metrics
    - engagement with the assessment metrics

### Prevent Overweight and Obesity among Young Children and Their Families in a Disadvantaged Municipality

- Theory
  - social effectiveness of interventions
    - intervention can only be socially effective if it
        1. creates a shared understanding between researchers and professionals
        2. reconfigures the social relationships between researchers and professionals through processes of “exchange”
  - Design-based research
  - Innovative Facilitation
      1. proactive facilitator
         - instructive; the content is defined, the process described, and relations established in talking and listening positions;
      2. active facilitator
         - participants and the facilitator being equal, despite having different responsibilities
      3. reactive facilitator
         - participants’ own responsibility and prevents the participants from free-wheeling, the idea being that the participants move the process forward, while the dynamics are adjusted or elicited by the facilitator;
      4. passive facilitator
         - acts in a less assertive fashion and is only responsible for being available if the participants express the need for a facilitator
- Studies
  - Interviews with Key Stakeholders
    - front-line staff
    - mid-level managers
    - heads of units

## Readiness to prescribe: Using educational design to untie the Gordian Knot

- Theories
  - Capability-Opportunity-Motivation-Behaviour (COM-B) [@Michie2011-zt]
    - Two types of motivations
      - reflective (conscious)
      - automatic motivation (habit).
    - Influenced by
      - psychological capability
      - the social opportunities their practice environments provide.
  - Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CIFR).[@Damschroder2009-mo]
