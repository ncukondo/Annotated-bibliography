# Design based research

## Characteristics

1. Focus on complex problems in real learning context
2. Continuous cycles of
    - Design
    - Evaluation
    - Redesign
3. Based on theoretical principles
4. Mixed-methods studies
5. designers, researchers, and practitioners work together

### Compare to action research

- Same
    - Iterative process
    - Cyclic process
        - Design
        - Evaluation
        - Redesign
    - Evaluating....
        - particular intervention meets certain basic standards
        - aspects of the intervention need improvement
- Difference
    - DBR require connection with theories
    - DBR testing or refining  theories

### Pitfalls

- Only of practical relevance for local situation
    - To avoid
        - grounding the design on theories and using theories to explain the findings.
        - detailed description of the context
        - generating design principles
- Does not advance theories
- The involvement of the researcher bias findings
    - To avoid
        - Triangulation of data sources and data methods
        - reflexivity
- DBR is risky, complicated, and time-consuming
        - teachers or learners may withdraw
        - circumstances may change

### Application

#### Research Questions

- How does it work?
- Why does it work?

#### Application

- Work-based learning
- Assessment

#### Example in AMEE No.60

## Design and evaluation of a clinical competency committee

- Research questions
    - how CCCs actually function in practice
    - how their performance should be evaluated
        - to see effect of an intervention in a real-life setting
- Design principles
    1. data from multiple assessment tools and multiple perspectives
    2. a shared mental model
    3. structured discussion to reach consensus
- Evaluation methods
    - Observation of the meeting using a semi-structured observation guide
    - Individual, semi-structured interviews with all members of the committee
    - Questionnaire with open-ended questions to be completed by all residents

## Design and evaluation of a learning assignment in the undergraduate medical curricula on the four dimensions of care

![](Design%20based%20research/2022-12-29-10-51-02.png)

- Four Dimensions of care
    - physical
    - psychological
    - social
    - spiritual
- Research Question
    - How do students and teachers evaluate an assignment in which students communicate with a chronically ill patient about the four dimensions of care, provide each other with peer feedback and reflect?
- Theoretical principle
    - authentic task
    - peer feedback and reflection
- Studies
    - QUAL
        - Thematic analysis
        - focus groups with students
        - interviews with teachers
        - an analysis of reflection reports
    - QUAN
        - SPSS
        - Student evaluation form
- Cycle
    - we evaluate the intervention to redesign it
    - no redesign was described
    - just one cycle?

## Co-Designing an Intervention to Prevent Overweight and Obesity among Young Children and Their Families in a Disadvantaged Municipality

- Theory
    - social effectiveness of interventions
        - intervention can only be socially effective if it
            1. creates a shared understanding between researchers and professionals
            2. reconfigures the social relationships between researchers and professionals through processes of “exchange”
    - Design-based research
    - Innovative Facilitation
        1. proactive facilitator
           - instructive; the content is defined, the process described, and relations established in talking and listening positions; 
        2. active facilitator
           - participants and the facilitator being equal, despite having different responsibilities
        3. reactive facilitator
            -  participants’ own responsibility and prevents the participants from free-wheeling, the idea being that the participants move the process forward, while the dynamics are adjusted or elicited by the facilitator;
        4. passive facilitator
            - acts in a less assertive fashion and is only responsible for being available if the participants express the need for a facilitator
- Studies
    - Interviews with Key Stakeholders
        - front-line staff
        - mid-level managers
        - heads of units
