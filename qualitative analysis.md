## Custom scale for quality of qualitative analysis

| Name | Description | Main references |
|- | - | - |
| Depth | Evaluate the depth and richness of the analyses. Consider if it goes beyond a mere description of the data and provides meaningful interpretations. On the scale, 1 should represent superficial and 7 in-depth. | [@Tong2007-lj] |
| Confirmability | Evaluate the confirmability of the analysis, considering its accuracy in relation to the text. On a scale from 1 to 7, 1 represents no correlation and 7 represents a strong correlation. | [@Braun2019-qn;@OBrien2014-rw;@Saldana2021-he] |
| Credibility | Consider whether the analysis accurately aligns with the research question. On a scale ranging from 1 to 7, 1 indicates complete lack of credibility and 7 indicates high credibility. | [@Stenfors2020-zb] |
| Transferability | Consider whether the analysis is applicable in other contexts. On a scale ranging from 1 to 7, 1 indicates complete lack of transferability and 7 indicates high transferability. | [@OBrien2014-rw;@Lumsden2022-hz] |
| Dependability | Consider the extent to which transparency is ensured in the analysis and whether the process is clear. On a scale from 1 to 7, 1 represents low dependability and 7 represents high dependability. | [@OBrien2014-rw;@Saldana2021-he] |
| Consistency | Consider whether the analysis is free from inconsistencies and remains consistent throughout. On a scale ranging from 1 to 7, 1 indicates complete lack of consistency and 7 indicates high consistency. | [@Frambach2013-wx] |
