# Entrustable decision and AI

- dataset
  - feedback narratives each paired with an assigned ES level
  - generated during low-stakes, high frequency directly observed clinical encounters of clerkship-year medical students
  - 3328 individual assessments from 216 students
  - observed by 1455 supervisors
  - (students required to collect 2 assessments per week)
- training
  - a supervised ML approach
  - trained the DNN to predict ES levels from feedback narratives
- Result
  - Low-to-moderate discrimination ability (AUC 0.6–0.7)
    - for ES Levels 2 through 4 (higher levels of entrustment, lower levels of supervision).
