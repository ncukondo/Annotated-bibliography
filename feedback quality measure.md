# Feedback Quality Measure

## For feedback comment

### Categorized matrix for feedback comment

- Performance
  - describe the student’s performance on which the feedback is provided
- Judgment
  - include a judgment to denote the gap between this performance and a standard
- Elaboration
  - contain an elaboration statement that builds further on the judgment
- Improvement
  - provide strategies on how the student’s performance can be improved

| Code | Definition |
| -- | --|
| Performance | The task on which the feedback is provided. This task must be observable. |
| Judgment | An adjective used to denote the gap between the performance and a standard.<br><br> It is an evaluative statement expressed as a judgment on past performance. |
| Elaboration | Informative statement that builds further on the judgment expressed as a  question, confirmation,<br> suggestion, or justification… (e.g. it indicates what went well or did not go well, why it went well or not…). In doing so, it gives more details about the judgment. |
| Improvement | The aim of feedback is to improve the trainee’s performance. The feedback must suggest strategies for improvement. |

### Rubrics for feedback

#### for narrative feedback in medicine of biomedical sciences student

- Bachelor  of  Science  (undergraduate)  curricula  of  Medicine   and  Biomedical  Sciences
- to assess the quality of narrative feedback for curirriculum by students

![](feedback quality measure/2024-03-19-20-54-23.png)

- required sample size
  - 80 feedback per group(https://chat.openai.com/share/02b76d68-9f8b-454e-85e4-7be0dbecc7fd)

#### to compare human and ChatGPT feedback

- feedback for essay writing in Grades 6-12
  - source-based argument essays in history
- feedback by
  - human teachers(16)(20-25min/essay)
  - ChatGPT(v3.5)
- 200 hundred pieases of feedback
- rubric developed by
  - deductive  framework to  score human- and ChatGPT-generated feedback across the five components  of  quality  formative  feedback

##### Criteria-based

- **Score Category**: Criteria-based feedback should explicitly reference criteria for quality source-based argument writing in history (SBAW).
  - **5**: Consistently explicitly references criteria of SBAW; minimal to no feedback is generic.
  - **4**: Most feedback references criteria; some feedback is generic.
  - **3**: Half of the feedback explicitly references criteria and half is generic.
  - **2**: Most feedback is generic; one piece somewhat references criteria.
  - **1**: Does not explicitly reference criteria; all feedback is generic.

##### Clear directions for improvement

- **Score Category**: Feedback should mark what a writer has done well and be specific about where and how they can improve.
  - **5**: Consistently gives clear directions for improvement; offers specific examples; all feedback is clear.
  - **4**: Mostly offers usable feedback; some is less clear.
  - **3**: Even mix of specific and vague suggestions.
  - **2**: Minimal references to specific student writing or lacks actionable steps.
  - **1**: Does not reference specific student writing and does not give concrete steps aligned with rubric/prompt.

##### Accurate

- **Score Category**: Feedback must be accurate for cognitive and affective reasons.
  - **5**: All feedback is accurate.
  - **4**: Most feedback is accurate; one piece is somewhat inaccurate.
  - **3**: Some feedback is accurate; some clearly inaccurate.
  - **2**: Feedback is mostly inaccurate.
  - **1**: Feedback is inaccurate, irrelevant to student writing.

##### Prioritization of essential features

- **Score Category**: Feedback should respond to appropriate elements of writing and mention the next step in development.
  - **5**: All feedback focuses on the most appropriate priority to work on.
  - **4**: Most feedback is attainable and reasonable; prioritizes one of the most appropriate things.
  - **3**: Even mix of prioritizing essential and nonessential features.
  - **2**: Most feedback is unattainable, nonessential, or inappropriate.
  - **1**: Feedback is too difficult or does not mention any essential features.

##### Supportive tone

- **Score Category**: Quality of feedback ranges from unsupportive and directive to affirming and supportive.
  - **5**: Consistently affirming; uses suggestive and respectful language.
  - **4**: Most feedback uses suggestive/supportive language, some does not.
  - **3**: Even mix of suggestive/directive language.
  - **2**: Most language is directive or lacks any positive affirmation.
  - **1**: No positive comments and no suggestive, respectful language.

##### Schema

- valence
  - positive/reinforcing vs negative/corrective
- specificity
  - specific vs nonspecific
- relevance
  - relevant vs irrelevant

##### Rubric table

- used to evaluate the feedback in basic surgical skills curriculum

[@Zhou2023-dc]

| | Definition | Example with Explanation |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Relevance: Relevant | References the task | “Great fluid movement!”<br> This is relevant in that “fluid movement” references an aspect of the task (quality of movement) |
| Valence: Reinforcing | Any positive feedback | “Very nice job using your index finger to push down the throws.”<br> This is reinforcing in that it encourages the continued use of their index finger to push down throws |
| Valence: Corrective | Any feedback that identifies an area of improvement | “Try not to tension the suture on the ‘vessel’ as much”<br> This is corrective in that it identifies too much tension as an area of improvement. |
| Specificity: Pragmatically Specific | Specific feedback that may require inference from context clues | “Great job overall! you can increase your working distance because you are using a very small loop,”<br> This is pragmatically specific in that it points out one aspect of improvement (increasing working distance) but does not clearly define the amount by which to increase the working distance. |
| Specificity: Semantically Specific | Specific feedback that does not require inference on the part of the recipient | “Consider 1-2'' longer working distance.”<br> This is semantically specific in that it clearly defines the length by which to increase the working distance. |
