## ChatGPT

> It is crucial for medical educators to keep pace with technology's rapidly changing landscape and consider the implications for curriculum design, assessment  strategies, and teaching methods. [@Lee2023-qp]

## Why it is important

### Ability

- Can be applied to various situations and languages by using pre-trained models on vast data [@Strong2023-qy]
- Contrary to many AI systems that require extensive data for training, Large Language Models (LLMs) can be utilized in various contexts with minimal or no training [@Tsang2023-iq]

### Usage

#### Students

- Support students to seek information [@Feng2023-sh]
  - allowing them to better understand the content of the course
- Use of ChatGPT for students to write reports [@Moritz2023-pk]

#### Teachers

- Generating instructional materials [@Moritz2023-pk]

#### System

- Personalization [@Feng2023-sh]
  - considering learning styles, weaknesses, and strengths
- Real-time feedback [@Feng2023-sh; @Tsang2023-iq]
  - to students
  - to teachers

### Important mechanisms

- transformer architectures and the underlying attention mechanism
  - better understand the relationships between words in a sentence
- use of pre-training, where a model is first trained on a large dataset before being fine-tuned on a specific task
  - few-shot learning capability

[@Kasneci2023-ig]

### Concerns

- Ethical concerns [@Sallam2023-mu]
  - bias
  - plagiarism
  - data privacy
  - security
- legal issue [@Sallam2023-mu]
  - intellectual property
  - liability

## AI in general

### trainee doctors’ perceived impact of AI technologies on clinical training and education

- The majority (58%) perceived an overall positive impact of AI technologies on their training and educatio 
- AI would reduce clinical workload (62%) 
- improve research and audit training (68%)
- Trainees were skeptical that it would improve clinical judgement (46% agree, p = 0.12)
- practical skills training (32% agree, p < 0.01). T
- he majority reported insufficient AI training in their current curricula (92%), and
- supported having more formal AI training (81%).

### Implications of AI for medical education

- the rise of AI systems is associated with a fundamental paradigm shift in teaching.
- The speed at which new health AI technologies are developing, being introduced into clinical practice, and being used by patients requires equipping doctors to deal appropriately with experimental techniques that have not yet become part of a generally accepted body of knowledge.
- agile teaching and educated guesswork about which treatments will benefit patients
