# a survey of trainee doctors’ perceived impact of AI technologies on clinical training and education

- The majority (58%) perceived an overall positive impact of AI technologies on their training and educatio 
- AI would reduce clinical workload (62%) 
- improve research and audit training (68%)
- Trainees were skeptical that it would improve clinical judgement (46% agree, p = 0.12) 
- practical skills training (32% agree, p < 0.01). T
- he majority reported insufficient AI training in their current curricula (92%), and
- supported having more formal AI training (81%).

# the implications of artificial intelligence (AI) for medical education. 

- the rise of AI systems is associated with a fundamental paradigm shift in teaching.
- The speed at which new health AI technologies are developing, being introduced into clinical practice, and being used by patients requires equipping doctors to deal appropriately with experimental techniques that have not yet become part of a generally accepted body of knowledge.
- agile teaching and educated guesswork about which treatments will benefit patients

# Artificial Intelligence in Undergraduate Medical Education: A Scoping Review

1) a need for an AI curriculum in UME, 
2) recommendations for AI curricular content including machine learning literacy and AI ethics, 
3) suggestions for curriculum delivery, 
4) an emphasis on cultivating "uniquely human skills" such as empathy in response to AI-driven changes, and 
5) challenges with introducing an AI curriculum in UME.
