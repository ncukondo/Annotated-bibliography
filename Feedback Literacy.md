### Four feactures

1. Appreciating feedback
   - Recognising the value of feedback
   - Understanding  their active role in its processes
2. Making judgments
   - capability to make decisions about the quality of work of oneself and others
   - needs sustained opportunities for comparison with the views of others
3. Managing affect
   - feedback often provokes negative affective reactions and threats to identity
   - so how students manage their emotional equilibrium impacts on their engagement with critical commentary
   - Affective responses to feedback are mediated by studentsâ€™ relationships with their teacher and with other participants as they construct meanings together
     - depending on a range of factors, including student self-efficacy, motivation and ability to handle emotions constructively
4. Taking action
   - act upon comments that they have received
   - engage actively in making sense of information and use it to inform their later work, thereby closing a feedback loop

## Why?

- One of the main barriers to effective feedback is generally low levels of student feedback literacy
- common discourses of students as consumers may also reinforce instrumental attitudes to learning and inhibit students from taking responsibility for developing their own knowledge and skills
