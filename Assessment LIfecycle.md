# Assessment and feedback lifecycle

Not focus on assessment tools, but see while system as lifecycle

1. Specifying
    - the process of determining the details of a course or programme of study and consequently the assessment strategy within it
    - Technology
       - digital curriculum
           - e-syllabass
2. Setting
    - The purpose of setting is to achieve clarity for both students and staff: what is required, in what format, by when and how it will be assessed
    - Technology
       - online template
3. Supporting
    - Helping each student do their best work for each assignment. However the real purpose is developing students' assessment literacy so that they understand what is involved in the process of making academic judgements
    - Technology
        - formative feedback
          - online quizz or testing
          - electronic voting systems
4. Submitting
   - The process of students handing over their completed assignment to the appropriate person so that marking and/or feedback can take place
   - Technology
       - E-submission is rapidly becoming the norm
5. Marking and production of feedback
   - student work is formally evaluated against a set of predefined assessment criteria with marks and feedback provided
   - purpose
       - To give a piece of work a final grade in relation to the assessment criteria
       - To provide feedback to aid student longitudinal development.
   - Technology
       - e-marking and e-feedback 
6. Recording of grades
   - the culmination of marking and moderation processes  
   - give each summative assignment a definitive grade that describes how well the student has met the criteria for the assignment and hence the learning outcomes
   - Technology
       - marks recording systems
7. Returning marks and feedback
   - informs students about the outcomes of an assessed piece of work
   - Technology 
       - post marks and feedback direct to individual students without the need for manual intervention 
8. Reflecting
   - The aim of this stage is to ensure that students engage with their feedback and use it to improve their future performance
   - Technology
       - store feedback and make it accessible to students and staff
       - self-reflection on a portfolio of work and dialogue around feedback
