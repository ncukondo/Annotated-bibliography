[@Huang2012-it]

## Importance of the reflective logbook

  - clinicians learn by reflecting on their clinical encounters with patients or classroom exercises, or meetings with their mentors
- Reflection may improve
  - clinicians’ performance
  - critical thinking skills
  - help them learn more about how to communicate with patients
  - set their goals, meet patients’ needs, and contribute to a viable patient-clinician relationship
- How to Reflect
  - Take notes during their clinical rotation on which the learner can reflect later
  - Reflective log book
    - reflective logbooks and well-designed rubrics could be useful and effective for learners to write down their activities and reflect on their activities, followed by receiving continuous feedback and guidance from their mentors
    - logbooks are useful in
      - continuous assessment
      - group learning
    - logbooks...
      - encouraged interaction between the learners and mentors
      - a good tool for receiving and providing feedback

## Clinical logbooks and performance

### Quality of supervision matters more than number of clinical encounters

[@Wimmers2006-tf]

### Clinical logbooks do not predict clerkship performance

- a pocket-sized handwritten patient log
   1. patient encounters
       - e.g., 72-year-old male with dyspnea and congestive heart failure
   2. examinations
       - e.g., fundoscopy, breast exam
   3. procedures
       - e.g., peripheral IV, suturing
- Grades
  - faculty and resident evaluations of student performance
  - standardized end-of-rotation knowledge
- Result
  - correlation analyses between logbook entries and clerkship grades
  - correlation between volume of clinical experience and clerkship grades were less than 0.4

### Students' logbook case loads do not predict final exmam score

[@Alabbad2018-ea]

### Clinical encounter and performance

- clinical experience during the students’ clerkship had a small but positive relationship with students’ clinical performance
