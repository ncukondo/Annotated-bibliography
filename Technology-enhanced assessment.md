# Technology-enhanced assessment

## Ottawa 2022 statement

- Uncritical adoption of (new) technologies in assessment brings substantial risk

### Three stages model

1. STAGE 1 Assessing readiness to adopt technologyto enhance assessment
    - Assessment fit for purpose?
        - A review of existing assessment
    - What is the purpose of adopting TEA?
    - The importance of digital equity within TEA?
    - Programmes, people, products, and processes?
        - Programmes
        - People
        - Processes
        - Products
2. STAGE 2: Applying technology within the‘assessment lifecycle’
    1. Principle 1: Advancing assessment authenticity
        - less focus on the measurement and technical development of assessment tools
    2. Principle 2: Engaging learners with assessment
        - prefer to learn by doing (Marzano and Kendall2007)
    3. Principle 3: Enhancing design and scheduling of assessment
        -  impactful using Work Based Assessment(WBA)
            - learner-centred
            - opportunistic cultures of performance assessment
    4. Principle 4: Optimising assessment delivery and recording of learner achievement
        - Video-based Examiner Score Comparison and Adjustment (VESCA) 
        - balance 5 keys
            1. Trust
            2. Professionalism
            3. Active proctoring
            4. Detection and security
            5. Consequences
    5. Principle 5: Tracking learner progress and faculty activity
        - AI-based technologies
            - predict learner success or failure
        - intelligent systems design
            - ‘gather and guide,’using data to identify and meaningfully
                - support learners at risk of future failure (Foster and Siddle,2020)
                - support self-regulation
                - support better learner choices
        - benefit 
            - freeing up the cognitive load of humans
                - focus faculty time on learner support
            - data-driven rapid remediation (Ricketts and Bligh2011)
            - coaching and mentoring approaches (Malecka and Boud2021)
            - considered use of behavioural nudges (Damgaard and Nielsen2018)
            - specialist case management
        - portfolios as communication tools for learning and feedback
3. STAGE 3: The impact of TEA usage needs evaluating
    - Narratives of design, implementation and evaluation oftechnology-enabled assessments need diversity too
