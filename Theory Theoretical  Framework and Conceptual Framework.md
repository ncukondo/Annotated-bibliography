## The Distinctions Between Theory, Theoretical  Framework, and Conceptual Framework

### Theory

Abstract description of the relationships between ideas, statements, and concepts that helps us understand the word

### Theoretical framework

- logically developed and connected set of concepts  and premises
- developed from one or  more theories
- a theoretical framework is a reflection of the work the researcher engages in to use a  theory in a given study

#### Answer the question

- How does this theory shape the study?

### Conceptual framework

justification for why a given study should be conducted

1. describes the state of known knowledge, usually through a  literature review
2. identifies gaps in our understanding of a phenomenon or problem
3. outlines the methodological underpinnings of the research project

#### Answer these two questions

- Why is this research important?
- What contributions might these findings make to what is already known?
