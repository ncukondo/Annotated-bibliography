## Four paradigms

- **constructivism**
  - understanding, multiple participant meanings, social and historical construction, theory generation ...
- **advocacy/participatory**
  - political, empowerment issue-orientated, collaborative, change-orientated ...
- **pragmatism**
  - consequences of actions, problem-centred, pluralistic, real-world practice orientated’

## Six key strands of the ‘pragmatism’ continuum

- **Methods**
  - use both qualitative and quantitative
- **Logic**
  - use both inductive and deductive
- **Epistemology**  (knower<->known  relationship)
  - accept subjectivity and objectivity (‘epistemological relativism’) 
- **Axiology**  (the  role  of  values)
  - accept that values influence interpretation
- **Ontology**  (nature  of  reality)
  - accept ‘external reality’, but the best explanations for outcomes
- **Causation**
  - accept that causal relationships are possible, yet elusive
