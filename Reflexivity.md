### Design and evaluation of a learning assignment in the undergraduate medical curricula on the four dimensions of care

> This assignment was developed by a multidisciplinary group that included teachers, educational theorists, researchers and physicians. Researchers JP and DV coded and analysed the data. JP is a doctoral student with a background in psychology and educational research. DV is an educational theorist with extensive experience in educational research. Due to the background of these two researchers, the analysis focused primarily on the students’ learning process and the design principles. Both  researchers  co-designed  the  assignment.  Researchers DD, MvdB and FW contributed ideas and helped shape the analysis. DD is an educational scientist and has expertise in instructional design. MvdB is an internist and medical consultant palliative care. FW is a researcher and former general practitioner with expertise in both palliative care as well as medical education. The different perspectives have enhanced the strength of this paper. But the disparate backgrounds also may have influenced our views on educational principles and the assignment itself.

> Of the five members of the research team, FT is an educational sociologist specializing in gender studies (particularly men and masculinity studies), and the rest are doctors specializing in general internal medicine or family medicine. HN is a medical education researcher. TM is a woman, and the other four are men. We recognized that the data obtained from the interviews would be constructed through the interaction between the interviewee and the interviewer. Therefore, when analyzing the interviewees’ words, we also considered the interviewers’ reactions. In particular, when analyzing the polysemic and ambiguous words uttered by the interviewees, we not only interpreted them based on the content of the conversation before and after but also paid attention to how they understood the questions posed by the interviewer and what discourse they presented. All the five team members had experience in childcare. The first author (NK), a male family physician who led the data collection and analysis, experienced single parenting, which is rare for male doctors in Japan, and struggled greatly with work-life balance. As it was anticipated that his personal experiences would be projected onto data collection and analysis, NK shared his reflections at regular research team meetings and other members commented.
