## Design and evaluation of a learning assignment in the undergraduate medical curricula on the four dimensions of care

> This assignment was developed by a multidisciplinary group that included teachers, educational theorists, researchers and physicians. Researchers JP and DV coded and analysed the data. JP is a doctoral student with a background in psychology and educational research. DV is an educational theorist with extensive experience in educational research. Due to the background of these two researchers, the analysis focused primarily on the studentsâ€™ learning process and the design principles. Both  researchers  co-designed  the  assignment.  Researchers DD, MvdB and FW contributed ideas and helped shape the analysis. DD is an educational scientist and has expertise in instructional design. MvdB is an internist and medical consultant palliative care. FW is a researcher and former general practitioner with expertise in both palliative care as well as medical education. The different perspectives have enhanced the strength of this paper. But the disparate backgrounds also may have influenced our views on educational principles and the assignment itself.
