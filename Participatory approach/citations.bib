  abstract = "Collaborative robots (cobots) can improve productivity by
              flexibly assisting production workers. Nevertheless, due to
              missing use cases, cobots have yet to be widely adopted in
              manufacturing. Democratizing robot programming by introducing
              cobots in public fablabs (or makerspaces) could lead to new
              applications transferrable to industry thanks to the creativity
              of interested laypersons. Fablabs could also mitigate the risk of
              unemployment due to automation by training cobot programmers for
              manufacturing jobs. In support of the proposed approach this
              paper introduces a participatory three-layer programming model
              designed to enable people with little or no programming
              experience to become effective cobot operators. The model builds
              on task-oriented programming environments extending them by more
              versatile yet intuitive programming environments. The model has
              been successfully evaluated on the basis of a real human-robot
              assembly application.",
