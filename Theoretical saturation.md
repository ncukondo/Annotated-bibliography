# Theoretical saturation

- Saturation must be viewed at a conceptual and theoretical level, rather than at a data level
- sufficient data has been collected for the researcher to have gained an adequate understanding of the dimensions and properties of the concepts and themes that have emerged
- data
collection can stop when a complete and convincing theory has been developed that provides a plausible account of the data without gaps or leaps of logic

AMEE Guide No. 70 by @Watling2012-vz

- point in data collection where interviews are either no longer generating new information or when researchers determine that they have “heard it all.” [@LaDonna2021-fh]

## Challenges for saturation

- a philosophical question about whether theories, data or themes can ever be truly saturated [@Varpio2017-pa]
- most (if not all) project proposals require researchers to state the sample size ahead of the study  [@Varpio2017-pa]
- saturation may be a concept suited to positivist and post-positivist qualitative methodologies [@Varpio2017-pa]

## Alternative ideas

### Sufficiency

- meaning the stage at which categories appear to manage new data without requiring further modifications [@Varpio2017-pa]
- qualitative findings are sufficient depends on examining them alongside the aims of the study [@LaDonna2021-fh]
- Unlike saturation, which likens a dataset to a sponge with an objective saturation point, the notion of sufficiency suggests that—within a research paradigm that acknowledges both the uniqueness of human experience and the socially constructed nature of data—researchers can metaphorically wring out their dataset, continuously dipping into a well of new understanding by iteratively revising interview guides, sampling new participants, and engaging in multiple rounds of data generation and analysis [@LaDonna2021-fh]

### 5 key dimensions

1. Study aim
2. sample specificity
3. established theory
4. quality of dialogue
5. analysis strategy
