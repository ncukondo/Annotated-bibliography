# Participatory approach

## Participatory programming

### Why



### Layered team approach in Collaborative robot

Programming Layer | Task | Roles and Expertise | Required Training | Supporting techniques
-- | -- | -- | -- | --
Layer 1 | Basic assembly workflows (robot movements and tool actuation) | Assembly workers and laypersons with some assembly experience |  | Some technical training  (e.g. professional  school)
Layer 2 | Blockbased programs (task blocks, variables, and control structures) | Industrial engineers with computational thinking abilities and technical intuition  | Formal technical training and a programming course  | CAD-modelling, 3Dprinting, laser cutting 
Layer 3 | Advanced functionality (databases, connectivity, etc.)  | Software engineers with  advanced programming skills  | Formal software engineering training  | Internet / intranet, databases, cloud, MES
