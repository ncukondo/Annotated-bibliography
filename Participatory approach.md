# Participatory approach

## Participatory programming

### Why

- to designing human-centered technology[@Van_Leeuwen2023-do]
  - tailor the technological solution[@Van_Leeuwen2023-do]
  - identify the stakeholders’ needs [@Van_Leeuwen2023-do]
- a more human, creative, and effective relationship between those involved in technology’s design  and  its  use[@Cober2015-le]

- alleviate the mismatch between the design of LA platforms and the capacity and interests of educators and students[@Dollinger2018-fm]

### Participatory design in learning analytics(LA)

Current LA Issues | Potential of Co-Creation within LA
--|--
Mismatch between design and capacity | Increased flexibility and ‘fit for purpose’"
Invalid Inferences | Sensemaking
Reconceptualization from product to service | Change in process, long term adoption

[@Dollinger2018-fm]

### Designing human-centered technology

1. agentic positioning of central stakeholders
2. using a structured approach for the design phase
3. using educational theories to guide the whole process

[@Van_Leeuwen2023-do]

### Layered team approach in Collaborative robot

Programming Layer | Task | Roles and Expertise | Required Training | Supporting techniques
-- | -- | -- | -- | --
Layer 1 | Basic assembly workflows (robot movements and tool actuation) | Assembly workers and laypersons with some assembly experience |  | Some technical training  (e.g. professional  school)
Layer 2 | Blockbased programs (task blocks, variables, and control structures) | Industrial engineers with computational thinking abilities and technical intuition  | Formal technical training and a programming course  | CAD-modelling, 3Dprinting, laser cutting
Layer 3 | Advanced functionality (databases, connectivity, etc.)  | Software engineers with  advanced programming skills  | Formal software engineering training  | Internet / intranet, databases, cloud, MES

[@Ionescu2019-mm]

## Examples

### AI education and Participatory Design

- designing AI system, teacher dashboards
- tension between...
  - involving stakeholder
  - use of educational theory
- Teacher dashboards
  - AI system
  - visual displays of capture and visualization of students's activities
- Structure
  1. description of participatory design of teacher dashboards
  2. implications of connecting insights from the field of teacher professional vision to participatory design practices
